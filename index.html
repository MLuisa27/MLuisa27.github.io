                    Our users are not aware of the amount of possible fashionable outfits they already have in their own closet. This leads to people buying excessive amounts of clothes, rather than regularly rotating the clothes they already own. Our solution would implement a machine learning algorithm to put together outfits from already owned clothes for users. This allows our users to have more outfits without buying more clothes.
